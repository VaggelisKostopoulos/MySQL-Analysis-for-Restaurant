This project showcases my ability to design and analyze relational databases using MySQL. The database includes two tables:

- **menu_items**– stores details about each dish, such as name, category, and price.
- **order_details** – records customer orders, including quantities, order dates, and linked menu items.

I performed step-by-step analysis by:

1. Exploring and cleaning the menu_items table to understand the menu structure and pricing.
2. Analyzing the order_details table to identify sales trends and customer ordering behavior.
3. Combining both tables using SQL joins to uncover insights such as best-selling items, revenue per category, and seasonal trends.
